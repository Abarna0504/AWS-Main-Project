# 🌐 Serverless Contact Form Using AWS

A simple **serverless contact form** built using AWS services.  
Users can submit their name, email, and message — automatically sent to the admin via **Amazon SES**, without any traditional servers.

## ☁️ AWS Services Used
- **S3** – Hosts static website (HTML form)  
- **API Gateway** – Handles HTTPS POST request  
- **Lambda** – Processes form data  
- **SES** – Sends email notifications  
- **CloudWatch** – Logs and monitoring  
- **IAM** – Secure permissions for Lambda  

---

## ⚙️ Architecture Flow
1. User submits form → hosted on **S3**  
2. **API Gateway** triggers **Lambda**  
3. **Lambda** uses **SES** to send email  
4. **CloudWatch** monitors all logs
